Spark Streaming:
  Input data stream is converted to batches of input data by spark streaming. Then it is sent to spark engine and outputs 
  batches of processed data.
  Abstraction layer is DiscretizedStream or DStream (a sequence of RDDs) represents continous stream of data.
  Input can be flume,hdfs,kafka, twitter, etc . Output can be hdfs, databases , dashboards

StreamingContext:
  Main entry point of streaming functionality. Can be created by val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1))
  DStream can be created by, val lines = ssc.socketTextStream("localhost", 9999)
  To start netty server for tcp socket, nc -lk 9999
  To start computations, use ssc.start()
  To terminate computations, use ssc.awaitTermination() or  ssc.stop().
  Can be created from existing sparkcontext, val ssc = new StreamingContext(sc, Seconds(1))
  stop() stops the sparkcontext as well. To stop only streaminig context, set stopSparkContext= false

Input Dstreams:
  Sources - file systems, kakfa, flume
  When running spark streaming locally use local[2] instead of local. One thread for running the receiver (input Dstream) 
  and another for processing the recieved data.
  When running spark streaming in cluster, the cores allocated should be more than that of receivers else there will be not
  be threads to process the received data.

Streaming sources:
  FileStream - streamingContext.fileStream[KeyClass, ValueClass, InputFormatClass](dataDirectory). Files should be of same
  format . Polls the directory for new files. Once moved files should not be changed. Do not require running receiver.For
  text file stream, streamingContext.textFileStream(dataDirectory.
  QueueStream - DStream can be created as q queue of rdds, streamingContext.queueStream(queueOfRDDs). Each rdd pushed into
  the queue will be treated as a stream of batch rdd.

Receiever Reliablity:
  Unreliable receiver (one does not send acknowledgement to source) , Reliable receiver (sends acknowledgement)

Windowed DStream:
  Window time can be specified using val windowedStream1 = stream1.window(Seconds(20)) .Helps to agrregate the smaller 
  Dtstrems into larger one.
  Batch interval - how often the data is captured into a Dstream, typically this would be 1 sec
  Slide interval - how often a windowed transformation is computed.
  Window interval - how far back in time the windowed transformation goes.
  To aggregate data over large period of time, val win = dss1.reduceByKeyAndWindow((x,y) => x+y, (x,y) => x-y , 
  Seconds(300), Seconds(1)
  countByValueAndWindow used to count the values over the window
  
DStream transformations:
  repartition(num) - Change the level of parallelism by increasing/decreasing no of partitions
  transform - val sorted = dstream1.transform(rdd => rdd.sortBy(x => x._2, false))

Fault tolerance:
  Data replicated in atleast 2 worker nodes
  Checkpoint directory can be used to store the state in case if we need to restart the stream, ssc.checkPoint()
  When driver fails, ss.getOrCreate(checkPointDir, <function that creates new streaming context>). When restarted it picks
  from the checkpoint dir. If nothing found, it creates a new streaming context.
  Zookeeper and spark built in cluster manager monitors the driver for failures (use spark-submit -supervise to monitor)
  
Save Dstream:
  dstream1.foreachRDD(rdd, time) => {val repartitionRdd = rdd.repartition(1).cache() repartitionRdd.saveAsTextFile("test")}

SqlContext:
  To use spark sql, create a SQLContext and then use .toDF for an RDD to convert to Dataframe
