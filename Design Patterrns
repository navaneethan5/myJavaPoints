Factory Pattern:
- Create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.
- Create an interface and classes implementing it. Then create FactoryPattern class which contains methods to create objects. Then create a new class and create a Factorypattern object. Then invoke the method to create an object.
Abstract Factory Pattern:
- Create factory of factories
- Create interface1 & 2 implementing classes. Then create AbstractFactory that contains method. Create interface1Factory & 2 extending Abstractfactory.Then create a new class that creates factory pattern objects of interface2factory & 2. Then invoke the method to create an object.
Singleton Pattern:
- Creates only on object of the class. Can be accessed by the class itself
- Create a class with private constructor. Have a private static object definition. Create static method to create retrun the instance. Invoke the method using class.
Prototype Pattern:
- Creates the object using the clone of an object
- Create an abstract class with cloneable interface. Then create 3 objects extending abstract class. Then create a static hash table to store the map value as <string,class>. Use return method to return an object.clone.
