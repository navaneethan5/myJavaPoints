ModelViewController: model contains data, view represents GUI/system interacts user, controller contains buisness logic of the application.
MVC architecture: view listens to model and gets notified if data changes, controller listens model and view and it tells them what to do.
Observer Pattern: Implements provider(subject)/notifier(observer) . Whenever a change occurs in subject, the observer gets notified.
