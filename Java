- static variables are class level variables that can be shared across all instances of the class. static methods can contain only static variables.
- final keyword is used to make a static variable constant.
- Strings are immutable. When appended it creates a new string everytime which is memory inefficient. String builders is a class which is used to append strings in memory efficient way
- String buffer is synchronized compared to string buffer. String buffer is faster compared to string buider. Wherever the process/method is being accessed by single thread, using string builder would be efficient.
- ToString used to create string interpretation of an object which is used to debug.
- Private constructor is used to create singleton classes. A singleton class is one which limits the object creation to one and the private constructor ensures that no more than 1 object can be created at a time.
- Heap is used to store objects and stack is to store local variables and function calls. Heap fill throws out of memory error , stack fill throws stack overflow exception. Every thread has its own stack memory , All the threads share the same heap
- Interfaces can be implemented if we need to use a same method across arbitary objects
- Variables modfier - public can be accessed anywhere, private within the class, protected within the class/package/subclass, no modifier within the same package
- Static classes can be created with nested classes mentioned as static. To access Outclass.Innerclass = new Outclass.Innerclass()
- Plant plant = new Tree() . The left hand side decides which method to call and the right hand side decides which class to call. Polymorphism is used whenever parent class reference is used to refer child class object
- Upcasting - reference parent class to child object, Downcasting - Typecast upcasted parent reference to child object
- Generics - parameterie the types of elements in a collection. Helps early  detection of compile errors and ensures type safety
