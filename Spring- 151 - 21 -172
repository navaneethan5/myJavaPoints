- Basic jars: spring core, context, beans.
- Spring bean container: Application context = new FileSytemApplicationContext("beans.xml");   Person person = (Person)context.getBean("person");
- Types of context: FileSystemApplicationContext, ClasspathApplicationContext.
- Constructor arguments: can be configured to bean by adding "insert constructor-arg element" option.
- Property elements: can be configured to bean by adding "insert property element".
- Dependency injection: if an object1 requires another object2, then the object2 can be injected to the object1. To do this , create a setmethod and set the ref bean in object1
- Singleton bean scope: irrespective of no of times it is requested from the bean container it will give the same bean.
- Prototype bean scope: everytime a bean is requested from the container it gives a different bean.
- Init method: Method runs after all propeties are set(construtor runs before)
- Destroy method: Method runs when closing the bean context(if prototype is set, then the close method needs to be taken care by user)
- List property: List property can be added by using "insert list, insert value  element"; set property also same instead set cannot have duplicate values.
- List of beans: List of beans can be added by using "insert list, insert ref element"
- Inner beans: Instead of setting the property as bean, we can define the bean.
- Map property: Map property can be added by using "insert props, insert prop" element
- Map of beans: Map property can be added by using "insert map, insert entry" element.To use object as a key, we need to implement hashcode and .equals method.
- Auto wiring: Tells spring how to figure out the dependencies between beans and wire automatically.
- Bean setters : Whenever there is a dependency, we need to add the corresponding setter object to inject the beans and add corresponding entry in bean.xml
- Autowiring by type: Set the autowire property to "byType". Need to ensure that there are no ambiguites.
- Autowiring by name: Use this property when ambuguities present. Can be set by using "byName". Ensure the bean name matches with the property.
